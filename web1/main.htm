<p>Somewhere around <U>1375 years</U> before the birth of <EM>
Christ</EM>, an Egyptian pharaoh publicly changed his name.</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000022" SIZE="+2" FACE="Verdana">
That change signalled a return to long-standing tradition, 
a <U>hallmark of <STRONG>Egyptian</STRONG> culture</U> that 
flourished for more than three thousand years peacefully in the 
rich <EM>Nile River</EM> valley.</FONT> 

<FONT COLOR="black" SIZE="+1" FACE="Helvetica">
The king had been called Tutankhaton. The last portion of his name, 
aton, was the name for the sun-god, which, in the years before the 
king's reign, had achieved preeminence among the competing deities 
in Egyptian religious tradition.</FONT> 

<FONT COLOR="green" SIZE="+2" FACE="Times">
The king changed his name to the one by which he is known today -- 
<STRONG>TUTANKHAMEN</STRONG> or, more popularly, <EM>King Tut</EM> -- 
and ended the brief experiment in monotheism in favor of the older 
religion with its promise of an afterlife.</FONT>
